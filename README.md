##Solar Weather Station 

Is an Open Source project develop during the X Πweek (Week of July 11). 

[ΠWEEK](http://piweek.tumblr.com/post/147232081388/kaleidosnet-podremos-saber-si-llueve-y) /paɪ wiːk/ is an original idea by [Kaleidos](http://kaleidos.net/) and it consists in allowing employees from participant technology companies to leave their ongoing work in standby and dedicate an entire week to personal projects. 
A personal innovation week promoted by Kaleidos and also open to external companies that want to join.

Thanks to [SolidGear](https://solidgeargroup.com/) I join this one. And is already our second Πweek we participate. Yay!

The aim of this project was to start with a new environment (Xamarin), new language (c#) and new project([SWS](http://blog.aljaba.net/estacion-meteorologica-solar-autonoma-en-arqueros-de-madrid/)) providing the UI of SWS in a mobile devices. 

Solar Weather Station is a project created during this X Πweek. It is a fully autonomous station created with an arduino, RaspberryPi, sensors of temperature, humidity and more which sends constant updates through 3G network and receives the power from a solar battery panel. 

This project provides the UI of SWS to display the current weather from your mobile phone. 

Dealing with all the set up of the environment, frameworks needed to launch the request to the SWS API and creating a common UI from Android and iOS with XAML bindings. It was a full personal innovation week! 

Enjoy with it and let me know if there is any issue or enhancement!
